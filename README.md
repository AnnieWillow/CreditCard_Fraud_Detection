# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection

A machine learning project designed to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using real-world anonymized data. This capstone project was developed to demonstrate the application of data science and machine learning techniques in identifying patterns associated with fraud.

## 📌 Project Overview

Credit card fraud poses a significant threat in the financial sector. The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can classify transactions as legitimate or fraudulent based on transaction features. We used a dataset of anonymized credit card transactions and applied machine learning algorithms to build and evaluate the model.
